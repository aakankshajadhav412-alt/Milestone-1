1. Install Required Libraries

At the start of the notebook, it installs the tools you need:

!pip install transformers sentencepiece


These libraries give your notebook access to pre-trained AI models such as T5 and Pegasus.

2. Import Pre-trained Models

The file imports two summarization models:

from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Tokenizer
from transformers import PegasusForConditionalGeneration, PegasusTokenizer


T5 → A general-purpose text-to-text model.

Pegasus → A model built specifically for summarization tasks.

You can use either of them for your project.

3. Load the T5 Model
t5_model_name = "t5-base"
t5_tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(t5_model_name)
t5_model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(t5_model_name)


This code loads the T5-base model into memory.
It’s like loading a brain that already knows how to summarize text.

4. Use the Summarization Function

Your notebook defines a function named generate_summary():

def generate_summary(text, min_len=30, max_len=80, beams=5):
    input_text = "summarize: " + text.strip().replace("\n", " ")
    ...


✅ What it does:

Takes your text as input.

Uses the T5 model to generate a summary.

Lets you control the summary length using:

min_len → Minimum words in summary

max_len → Maximum words

beams → Controls creativity of output (higher = better quality summaries)

✅ How to use it:

text = "Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries by enabling machines to learn from data."
print(generate_summary(text))


This will print a short summary version of your text.

5. Experiment with Different Models

You can switch from T5 to Pegasus by replacing the model loading code with:

pegasus_model_name = "google/pegasus-xsum"
pegasus_tokenizer = PegasusTokenizer.from_pretrained(pegasus_model_name)
pegasus_model = PegasusForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(pegasus_model_name)


Then modify the function to use pegasus_model instead of t5_model.

6. Customize the Summary Output

You can adjust:

min_len and max_len → To make summaries shorter or longer.

num_beams → To make summaries more accurate or creative.

Input text → To summarize articles, reports, or essays.

7. Use It in Real Projects

Once you test the summarization, you can:

Integrate it into a Flask or Streamlit web app.

Use it for automatic report summarization in your electrical engineering projects.

Summarize research papers or EMI reports automatically.

🧩 Example

Input:

Lightning is a natural high-voltage electric discharge between clouds or between a cloud and the ground.


Output:

Lightning is a high-voltage discharge between clouds or the ground.
1. How the Model Works Internally

The model uses a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture — this means it reads text as input and then generates a new sequence of words (the summary).
Steps happening behind the scenes:

The input text is tokenized (converted into numerical tokens the model understands).

The model processes those tokens through multiple Transformer layers (attention-based neural networks).

It learns which words are most important.

It generates a shorter version (summary) that keeps the main meaning.

So, for example:

Input: “The T5 model is a transformer architecture that converts every NLP problem into a text-to-text task.”

Output: “T5 turns NLP problems into text-to-text tasks.”

🧩 2. Key Components You Can Explore

Your notebook includes:

T5 model loading (T5ForConditionalGeneration)

Tokenizer (T5Tokenizer) — breaks text into word pieces

Summarizer function (generate_summary) — handles the summarization

Parameters (min_len, max_len, num_beams) — control the summary quality

You can modify these parameters to experiment:

generate_summary(text, min_len=10, max_len=100, beams=8)

🧪 3. What You Can Try Practically
🧠 A. Summarize Articles or Reports

Copy and paste any article, research report, or news paragraph:

text = """Lightning is a natural high-voltage discharge between clouds or between a cloud and the ground.
It can cause significant damage to structures and electrical systems."""
summary = generate_summary(text)
print(summary)


It will produce:

Lightning is a high-voltage discharge that can damage electrical systems.

🧮 B. Summarize Technical Data

If you have technical project reports (like EMI, High Voltage, or simulation reports), you can use your notebook to create short, readable summaries.

🗂️ C. Summarize Multiple Files

You can modify your code to read a .txt or .csv file and summarize each paragraph:

with open("report.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
print(generate_summary(content))

🌐 D. Make It an Interactive App

You can later convert this notebook into a web app using:

Streamlit:

pip install streamlit


Then create an app that takes text input and shows summaries.

Gradio:

pip install gradio


For creating a beautiful, browser-based summarization tool.

💡 4. Advantages of Your Model

✅ Fast and accurate — summarizes text in seconds.
✅ Pretrained intelligence — no need to train from scratch.
✅ Customizable — works with any English text.
✅ Useful for students — summarize assignments, research papers, or technical documents.
✅ Lightweight — runs even on a normal laptop (CPU mode).

🧰 5. Optional Improvements You Can Add

If you want to upgrade your notebook:

Add Pegasus summarizer for better abstractive summaries.

Compare summaries from T5 and Pegasus side-by-side.

Add evaluation metrics like ROUGE score to measure accuracy.

Save summaries to a text file using:

with open("summary_output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(summary)


Deploy online using Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces.

📘 Example Workflow

Open your Jupyter Notebook

Paste or load your text

Run all cells

Call the function generate_summary()

View and save your summary
